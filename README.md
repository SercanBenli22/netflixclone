# Netflix Clone Sweden

This project contains a simple front-end design of a Netflix-like interface in Sweden, created using HTML and CSS. It does not provide live functionality, such as creating an actual Netflix account or streaming content.

## Content

- `index.html`: Main HTML file defining the structure and content of the web page.
- `style.css`: CSS file styling the web page.
- `images/`: Folder containing some images used on the page.
- `images/logo1.png`: Image of a Netflix-like logo.

## Usage

To run the project locally, simply open the `index.html` file in your browser or upload it to a web server.
